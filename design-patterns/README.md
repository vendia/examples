# Software Architecture Patterns

A software architecture is a description of the subsystems and components of a software system and the relationships between them. Subsystems and components are typically specified in different views to show the relevant functional and non-functional properties of a software system. The software system is an artifact. It is the result of the software design activity.

A component is an encapsulated part of a software system. A component has an interface. Components serve as the building blocks for the structure of a system.
At a programming-language level, components may be represented as modules, classes, objects, or as a set of related functions.

A subsystem is a set of collaborating components performing a given task. A subsystem is considered a separate entity within a software architecture. It performs its designated task by interacting with other subsystems and components.

An architectural pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization schema for software systems. It provides a set of predefined subsystems, their responsibilities, and includes rules and guidelines for organizing the relationships between them.

A design pattern provides a scheme for refining the subsystems or components of a software system, or the relationships between them. It describes a commonly recurring structure of communicating components that solves a general design problem within a particular context.

A framework is a partially complete software (sub-) system that is intended to be instantiated. It defines the architecture for a family of (sub-) systems and provides the basic building blocks to create them. It also defines the places where adaptations for specific functionality should be made.

We at Vendia plan to build a library of software patterns application to Vendia Share Universal Application(`Uni').

## Domain Driven Design
A software developer named Eric Evans recognized the need to understand the software domain. To introduce the DDD approach, he wrote a book called Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.

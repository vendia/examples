# Software Architecture Patterns

The `design-patterns` directory of this repo includes a collection of patterns for building solutions using Vendia Share.  The intent is to capture and share knowledge and experiences gained from working with Universal Applications ("Unis") on the Share platform.  Enjoy!

## Domain Driven Design
A software developer named Eric Evans recognized the need to understand the software domain. To introduce the DDD approach, he wrote a book called _Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software_.

Check out this set of [Domain Driven Design inspired patterns](design-patterns/domain-driven-design/README.md) to leverage when creating Unis on Vendia Share.

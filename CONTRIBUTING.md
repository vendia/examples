# Contributing Guidelines

Interested in contributing examples to our repository?

**Awesome!**  Thanks for making this repository better for everyone in the Vendia community. 

Read this document to understand how to report issues, provide new examples, and participate in the general development process. We've created a [style guide](./styleguide/README.md) as a reference.

## Submitting feature requests

We love features that help developers build applications with Vendia faster and further illustrate creative ways to share data with multiple partners. If you have ideas for new examples that might help the community, follow these steps to submit your feature request:

1. Scan through the list of [feature requests](https://github.com/vendia/examples/labels/type/feature).  If you find your feature there, mark it +1. This is a good indication of interest from the community.

2. If you don't find your feature in our backlog, create a new issue and assign the `Feature Request` label to it.

Keep in mind that features should be driven by real use cases.  Answer the following questions in the issue that you create:

- Does this feature simplify creating and deploying some aspect of a an application using Vendia products?

- Is this feature solving a problem faced by other Vendia application developers?

## Adding features to Existing Examples

We welcome pull requests to add new features to Vendia examples. Take a look at the backlog of [Feature Requests](https://github.com/vendia/examples/labels/feature-request) and pick an item that you find interesting. If the requirements have been well-scoped, feel free to make the change and send a pull request.

If you don't find an item tracking what you have in mind, start a conversation with your plan for implementing the feature.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/vendia/examples/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/vendia/examples/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can.  Details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The example being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *master* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.
4. You propose complete changes.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Stay involved in the conversation.

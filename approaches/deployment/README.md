# Deployment
Vendia Share provides a number of cloud-native [integration options](https://www.vendia.net/docs/share/integrations) to allow developers to act on data from Vendia Share as it changes.  Often, these integrations require a cloud service to be deployed or configured in a prescribed way (e.g. in a way that allows Vendia Share to successfully integrate).  The examples in this section explore proven ways to deploy these services.

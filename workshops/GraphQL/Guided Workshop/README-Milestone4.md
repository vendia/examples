# Milestone 4 - Vendia & GraphQL

In the previous section, we went over the basics of GraphQL in Vendia, covering how to query and how to add and modify data. In this section, we'll go a bit further, outlining how Vendia uses GraphQL to help you share data more effectively. We will be picking up where we left off in the Supplier and Distributor example. 





The Distributor is waiting for a notification that the Supplier shipped the order. Onward to [Milestone 5](README-Milestone5.md).

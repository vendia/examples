# Vendia Examples
This repository contains a variety of examples that highlight the capabilities of [Vendia Share](https://www.vendia.net/product).

## Common Prerequisites
Each example will have its own set of detailed prerequisites.  Two prereqs that are almost always needed (so worth getting now) are:

* A Vendia Share [Account](https://share.vendia.net/signup), used to access Vendia Share
* The Vendia Share [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://vendia.net/docs/share/cli), used to manage Unis on Vendia Share

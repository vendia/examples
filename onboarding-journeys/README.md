# Onboarding Journey
The `Onboarding Journey` directory of this repo includes a collection of step-by-step guides focusing on specific functionalities and features Vendia offers.

| Topic | Topic Level | Description |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| [Signing Up & Create Your Organization](./signing-create-org/README.md) | Beginner | The first basic step is to obviously sign up to our platform. And as an enterprise customer, it is crucial to create your organization on Vendia Share for future access management of your team.
| [Data Model & Uni Creation](data-modeling/README.md) | Beginner | Once your account creation is completed, you can create your first Universal Application (Uni) on our platform to get a sense of how Vendia Share works. While in the process of creating this, you’ll realize our Uni is directly tied to your data model/schema.
| [Put/Update/Delete Data In Your New Node](GraphQL/Guided%20Workshop/README.md) | Beginner | Now that your first Uni is created, it’s time for you to do your basic data actions on them. Without writing any code, you are able to add entities to your defined Uni with access control defined. 
| [File Sharing](smart-contract/README.md) | Beginner | Vendia Share also offers file sharing between Nodes. Once you have a Uni, you can share files at your node level by going to File Explorer.

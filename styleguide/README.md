# Style Guide

Below are a set of conventions contributors should use to write code and documentation. Using a common set of standards make it easier for others to learn and contribute their ideas over time.

# Terminology

* The [Vendia Share web application](https://share.vendia.net) should be referred to as `Vendia Share web application` or `Vendia Share web app`.

* The [Vendia Share command line interface (CLI)](https://www.vendia.net/docs/share/cli) should be referred to as the `Vendia Share CLI` or `Share CLI`.

* Parties that comprise a Uni should be referred to as `participants`.

* The term `Universal Application` and the abbreviated `Uni` should be capitalized as a proper noun.

* The word `node` should be lower-case.

* The word `participant` should be lower-case.

* Use [camel-case](https://wiki.c2.com/?CamelCase) when referring to a _specific_ `participant` (e.g. `ShippingCompany`).

* Use [camel-case](https://wiki.c2.com/?CamelCase) when referring to the `node` of a _specific_ `participant`. The name of the `node` should be **bold** (e.g. **ShippingCompanyNode**).

# Writing Style

* Use the following convention when adding a **NOTE:** to a document.

```
**NOTE:** This is something that should be brought to a user's attention
```

* Use the following convention when adding a **WARNING:** to a document

```
**WARNING:** This is a warning of a potentially dangerous action.
```

* Code snippets should be included in matching \`\`\` characters.

```
echo "This is sample code."
```

* Use the pronoun "you" and the the future tense "will" when providing instructions to readers. Contractions are ok - we're not monsters. ;-)

# Guidelines for Content Length

## Blogs

The ideal blog post length should be 2100 - 2400 words [according to HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-long-should-your-blog-posts-be-faq).
